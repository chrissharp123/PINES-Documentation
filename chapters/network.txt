Troubleshooting the Network
---------------------------

Types of Problems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The lines between Evergreen issues, wide-area network (WAN) issues, local area
network (LAN) issues, and individual PC workstation issues can be unclear, but
it is very important in troubleshooting to attempt to find out which category
your problem falls into before you can know how to handle it.  Some definitions
may be helpful.

* Evergreen – the open source software that runs on a Linux server cluster
administered by PINES/GPLS staff and their contractors.  The Evergreen Staff
Client connects to and interacts with this server cluster over the local area
and wide area network connections.  Both Staff Client and server-level problems
can be considered “Evergreen” issues.
* Wide Area Network (WAN) – the Peachnet network, administered by private
companies under state contract – either AT&T or Georgia Public Web (GPW),
depending on your geographical location.   If your library system contracts
individually for Internet service, that service provider will be your sole
contact for wide area network problems. 
* Local Area Network (LAN) – the network internal to your library, administered by
your local library system’s information technology (IT) staff.  
* Individual PC Workstation – the computer on which your staff or patrons are
working, administered by your local library system’s IT staff.  

An example of where the confusion between these areas of responsibility comes
about would be Evergreen “slowness,” a common complaint.  The PC workstation
could be short on memory or could have too many programs running at once.
Internal network bandwidth could be at capacity, causing all kinds of Internet
slowness, including the staff client.  There could be a network outage in one of
the service areas near your library.  Or finally, there could be a problem with
Evergreen that is causing slowness for everyone.  There are diagnostic tools
available to the Local System Administrator for troubleshooting each of these
trouble areas.

An easy way to check whether the PINES website is actually unavailable or if
something else is the problem is to check gapines.org at the site http://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/.  
You will get an instant result that will let you know whether other people on the 
internet are able to access the site.

TIP: The Peachnet Network implements a technique called Qualityof Service (QoS), 
which marks internet traffic to and from Peachnet IP addresses to be given priority 
over other internet traffic (such as a patron surfing the web).  It is recommended 
practice to make sure your local area network implements some sort of traffic 
shaping, such as a rule that staff computer stations have network priority over 
patron stations.  If your library does not use the Peachnet network, this benefit 
will not apply to you.

Sources for Help

* GPLS Intermapper – (http://netwatch.georgialibraries.org/) – Shows detailed
network information for the Peachnet Network, including device maps by library
unit.
* Local IT Staff – The first contact for all technical problems.   In libraries
where there are not dedicated IT staff, this responsibility will fall to the
“most technical” staff member in a system.  Inter-library sharing of IT
expertise is greatly encouraged.
* Internet Service Provider (ISP) – Your library system’s network provider - the
point of contact for networking issues if local area network problems are ruled
out.  
* GPLS Helpdesk – The method to contact either PINES/GPLS staff or GPLS IT for
issues within their respective areas of responsibility.
* GPLS Technology Site - (http://georgialibraries.org/lib/technology/) – Contains
information about GPLS provided services, FAQs, and best practices.
* TechTalk Mailing List and Discussion Board – connect with Local System
Administrators around the state (both PINES and non-PINES libraries) and ask
your technical questions.  There is a great deal of expertise in our collective
knowledge!
