Evergreen Local System Administration
-------------------------------------

Workstation Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Workstation settings within the Evergreen Staff Client are set via interfaces available from the Admin -> Workstation Administration menu.

Controlling Font Sizes and Sound
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There are two boxes in the window, "Adjust Sound" and "Adjust Global Font."  Adjust Sound has a single checkbox setting which, if checked, disables sound for the workstation.  "Save to Disk" saves the changes to your computer’s hard drive, making the change persistent.

Adjust Global Font allows you to click on the size font you would like to choose as your default size.  Each column of buttons affects the same default font (as opposed to a different font setting for each column) and is presented this way to easily tailor your font.

TIP: Sizes other than the default setting may break page designs within the staff client, though they would not affect functionality.  Also, some text sizes may not be alterable from within the staff client and would have to be globally changed in Windows appearance settings.

Hotkeys
^^^^^^^
"Hotkeys" are the keyboard combinations that invoke different staff client functions, which are notated beside each staff client menu option (e.g. "Check Out Items  F1").  The Hotkeys menu and submenus allow personalized configuration of the staff client and how it behaves on a per-workstation basis.

* Disable Hotkeys - disables/enables keyboard shortcuts (e.g. Ctrl-T for new tab)
* Current
* Default - the default hotkey set
* Minimal - a more minimal set - only window-related hotkeys
* None - disables Hotkeys
* Set Workstation Default to Current - preserves the selected setting under Current for this workstation
* Clear Workstation Default - un-does the above workstation setting

The Toggle Hotkeys button in the staff client toolbar allows you to quickly enable or disable hotkeys altogether.  This feature would be useful if one were running another program alongside the Evergreen staff client that required similar keyboard commands that would otherwise be in conflict.


Printer Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Setting up printers to work with the staff client is a two step process.

. Install and configure the printer to work with Windows.  This step does not involve the Evergreen Staff Client at all and will vary from printer to printer.  Please consult your printer's documentation for details.
. Configure the staff client to print to specific printer for specific functions.  This is described below.

The Printer Settings Editor (Admin -> Workstation Administration -> Printer Settings Editor) is an interface that allows the Local System Administrator to configure options for which printer Evergreen uses for different types of printing.    There are five "contexts" from which you can set your printing preferences:

. Default – selects the "fallback" printer if there are no other contexts selected.  If there is a single printer connected to the workstation being configured, this would be the only option to set.
. Receipt – sets the printer for checkout, checkin, and holds/transit receipt printing.
. Label – sets the printer for spine label printing.
. Mail – sets the printer for printing mailing labels (available from the checkout screen as well as in some other functions that PINES does not currently use).
. Offline – sets the printer to be used by the offline staff client.

For each context, click the radio button beside each one, then click "Set Default Printer and Print Test Page".

There is also an option, "Print silently when using Mozilla Print", which controls whether or not the printer dialog is invoked each time something needs 

Receipt Template Customization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Evergreen allows individual libraries to customize their receipts using editable templates.  The interface is accessible by going to Admin –> Local Administration -> Receipt Template Editor.  At the top of the screen is a drop-down menu that allows you to select which receipt you would like to edit.  Below that menu is a grayed-out drop-down menu labeled "Type."  This refers to the type of "item" (or "object" in programmer-speak) from which the template values are drawn.  The "Macros," which are the items surrounded by % marks, are "placeholders" for the actual information you would like to appear, and certain macros are available for each "Type" of object.  To see a list of available macros, click the "Macros" button on the upper right of the screen.  You can highlight a macro, then use Ctrl-C to copy and Ctrl-V to paste the macro into the receipt area.  Click "Preview" to refresh the Preview pane and see your changes.

"Default" returns the active template to the default setting and "Save Locally" allows you to keep the changes persistent at that workstation.  "Export" allows you to save the templates file to an external medium (such as a USB pen drive), and "Import" allows you to import that templates file into another workstation’s staff client for consistency across your library’s workstations.

To add library names and courier codes in large type to your library’s transit receipts, add the following lines to the "transit_slip" and "hold_transit_slip" receipt templates:
<font size="12">%route_to%<br />
%courier_code%</font>

Toolbar Customization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Toolbars sub-menu allows customizations that can be saved on a per-workstation, per-user, per-library, or per-system basis.

* Current
** circ - selects the circulation toolbar
** cat - selects the cataloging toolbar
** custom options would appear here too
** Default - selects the default toolbar as set in the Library Settings Editor.  In PINES, the default is "circ".
** None - disables the toolbar
* Icon Size - allows you to select Large or Small icons
* Label Position - allows you to select whether the labels appear next to or under the icons
* Mode - allows you to display icons, labels, or both
* Set Workstation Default to Current - preserves the selected setting under Current for this workstation
* Clear Workstation Default - un-does the above workstation setting
* Configure Toolbars - allows you to create new custom toolbars available to your user login, workstation, library, or system

To create a toolbar, follow these steps:

. Go to Admin -> Workstation Administration -> Toolbars and select Configure Toolbars.
. Click on the New Toolbar button in the upper right of the screen.  Provide a label for the new toolbar.  The new toolbar should appear on the list in the top window.
. Click on items in the lower left window and click the "(A) -->" button to add elements to the right window.  The elements you add will appear in a top-to-bottom order in the right window, which corresponds to a left-to-right order in the resulting toolbar.  To remove an element, select it in the right window and click the "<-- (R)" button.
. When finished, select the owning unit (library or system) from the dropdown and select the radio button labeled Owning Org Unit to make this toolbar available to your library or system.  Alternatively, select Owning Workstation for the change to affect the current workstation or Owning User, which will make it available to your own account whenever you log in.

There are several permissions that must be assigned for a user to be able to manage toolbars:

* ADMIN_TOOLBAR - required to enter the toolbar interface
* ADMIN_TOOLBAR_FOR_ORG - required to be able to save a system- or library-owned toolbar
* ADMIN_TOOLBAR_FOR USER - required to be able to save a user-owned toolbar
* ADMIN_TOOLBAR_FOR_WORKSTATION - required to be able to add a workstation-owned toolbar

Each of these permissions is granted to LocalAdmins so that they are grantable to other staff members within your system as needed.

Library Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Library System/Branch configuration is done via the Admin -> Local Administration Menu.  Many items reside in this menu area that were developed by other Evergreen-using libraries and have no current use in PINES.  Others are set at the PINES consortium level by GPLS/PINES staff. 

TIP: Just because an feature is listed in the Local Administration menu does not necessarily mean that it is available to staff with the LocalAdmin permission profile, because PINES manages so much centrally, as opposed to on a per-library basis.

Cash Reports
^^^^^^^^^^^^
This interface reports the amount of money taken in per workstation and totals cash, check, and credit card payments taken the previous open day.                               

Setting Library Closed Dates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Available by going to Admin -> Local Administration -> Closed Dates Editor.  This interface allows you to enter a library closing for your library branches.  

* Select the library for which you are entering a closing from the "Edit Closed Dates for:" dropdown menu.  A list of currently-entered closings will appear in date order.  
* To add a closing, select either "Add Single Day Closing" or "Add Multiple Date Closing" and carefully enter the dates, either by selecting from the built-in calendar tool (preferred) or by typing in the dates in YYYY-MM-DD format. 
* Then enter a reason for the closing and click "Save." 
* If your entire library system has the same closed date, you can check the "Apply to all of my libraries" checkbox before saving.  This will add the closing to each individual library’s list of closings. 
* The "Add Detailed Closing" feature, which allows closings for specific times of the day, is not currently used in PINES.

TIP: If incorrect dates are entered, for example, the start date is in 2010 but the end date for the closing is in 2009, the dates will not work at all.  Please check these carefully since the system does not alert you if you make this kind of mistake and it causes great confusion!

Adding a closing has the following consequences:

* During the closed dates (inclusive), books will not be due.  If a closing is added on a day when books are already due, they will be considered due on the next available open date.
* Holds will not target copies in a closed library.  Hold lists will not print on closed dates.  
* Patrons will not be charged fines on closed dates.  If the closing is added after the closed date has occurred, charges that have already accrued on patron accounts must be manually removed by staff.

TIP: The fines generator for PINES runs each morning at 12:30 a.m., meaning that the fines for each day have already accrued before the library workday starts.  In cases of emergency closings for inclement weather, etc., GPLS/PINES staff can run a process that will batch void fines accrued for those days.

Setting the Copy Location Order for Holds Pull Lists
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This is required for the "Print Full Pull List (Alternate Strategy)" option to sort by shelving location (or in any meaningful order).  

Setting up or Editing Copy Locations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Available by going to Admin -> Local Administration -> Copy Locations Editor.  

Existing Copy Locations for the Workstation’s library unit appear in the lower part of the screen.  The focus location can be changed via the "Focus Location" dropdown menu.  Copy Locations may be edited or deleted from this section.

Copy Locations can be set at either the System or the Branch level.  System-level Copy Locations will be available to all libraries in the system.  Branch-level Copy Locations are only available to the individual branch. The "PINES" copy locations are grayed out, as they are administered by PINES/GPLS staff.

The top interface allows you to create a new copy location and has the following fields:

* Name – the text name for the Copy Location, which is visible in the OPAC (for OPAC visible copy locations)
* OPAC Visible – this sets whether items in this Copy Location may be found in the OPAC by patron searches.
* Hold Verify – this setting is not used in PINES and its purpose is currently unknown.  Please select "No" for this field.
*oldable – this sets whether the items in this Copy Location are eligible for patron hold requests.
* Circulate – this sets whether the items in this Copy Location circulate.
* Owning Library – allows you to set the owning library or system.

If a Copy Location setting is set to "Yes," then item-level settings determine OPAC visibility, holdability, and circulatability.  If a Copy Location setting is set to "No," item-level settings are overridden.


Library Settings Editor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Available from Admin -> Local Administration -> Library Settings Editor.  The available functions include settings that PINES sets globally, rather than just local library/system settings. Each setting is controlled by permissions settings.

The following settings are available for local systems to configure as needed:

- Courier Code – This controls the value of the %courier_code% macro for your library in the Receipt Template Editor.  This should be already set with your stat courier code.
- Default Item Price – This sets the price of items where the actual price is not listed in the item record.
- Lost Materials Processing Fee – This sets the amount charged for a processing fee for your library/system.
- OPAC Inactivity Timeout (in seconds) – This setting defines how much time a patron can be idle at an OPAC before being automatically logged out.  System default is 7 minutes (420 seconds).  PLEASE NOTE:  This affects patrons both inside the library and logged in from home.
- Selfcheck: Patron Login Timeout (in seconds) – This sets a timeout for a patron logged into Evergreen’s built-in selfcheck interface.
- Selfcheck: Pop-up alert for errors – This setting controls whether or not patrons receive pop-up alert messages when errors occur in Evergreen’s built-in selfcheck interface.
- Selfcheck: Require patron password – This setting controls whether Evergreen’s built-in selfcheck interface requires a patron to enter a password upon login.
- Sending email address for patron notices – This allows library staff to set an email address that will appear to the person receiving emails from Evergreen to be the sending address.  This address receives any bounced emails, allowing for patron account corrections.
- Staff Login Inactivity Timeout (in seconds) – This setting defines how much time a staff member can be idle at a staff client before being automatically logged out.  System default is no time limit.

Settings may be changed by clicking "Edit" beside the setting you are trying to change.  A box will pop up, sometimes containing a description of the setting, sometimes not.  "Context" allows you to set at which level you would like to have your settings apply.  If settings are applied at the system level, they will also apply to all system branches.  If set for the individual library, the settings will be limited to that one library.  "Delete Setting" will remove the setting’s values from your library and restore them to the system default.

TIP: The number of available library settings has grown exponentially over the last few years.  You can type keywords into the "Filter" box to filter out irrelelvant settings.

TIP: Great care should be taken when changing library settings, as they will affect the operations of your entire library or system.  Please contact PINES staff if you would like to test settings for your system on a PINES test instance of Evergreen before “going live” with your changes.

Set Up or Edit Non-Cataloged Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Available from Admin -> Local Administration -> Non-cataloged Types Editor.   This interface is where you can set up or edit locally-defined non-cataloged items.  The list of non-cataloged types appears in the lower part of the screen, and includes whichever non-cat types set for the "Focus Location" (changeable via the dropdown menu).  These will appear to your library’s staff from the Checkout interface.
A new non-cataloged type can be created in the top interface by entering a name, selecting the time the item will circulate, whether it circulates in-house, and the organizational unit (system or individual branch) for which you would like the type to be available.


View Patrons with Negative Balances
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Admin -> Local Administration -> Patrons with Negative Balances.  This allows you to look up patrons with negative balances on their accounts per library (or system).  Because of the size of the PINES user and billings database, this may not function as expected.


Add/Edit Statistical Categories
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Available from Admin -> Local Administration -> Statistical Categories Editor.  This interface allows your library system to set up or edit locally-defined statistical categories for copies or patrons.  These statistical categories can then be set when adding patrons or cataloging copies and then used to generate reports on copy usage or patron statistics.  Use of statistical categories is entirely optional and governed by local needs (with a single exception, noted below).

The list of existing statistical categories appears in the lower part of the screen, and includes whichever categories set for the "Focus Location" (changeable via the dropdown menu).  There are two types of statistical categories, Patron and Copy:

Copy Statistical Categories
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Once set, these can be applied to individual copies in the Item Attributes Editor, available to cataloging staff.  The "Legacy CAT1" and "Legacy CAT2" categories were added to Evergreen to ensure continuity in reporting abilities from PINES’ previous automation system.

Patron Statistical Categories
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Once set, these can be applied to individual patrons in the Evergreen User Editor ("5. Statistical Categories").  The Non-English Primary Language is a category required by PINES policy, but any other categories are entirely up to local systems as to whether/how they are used.

A new statistical category can be created in the top part of the screen by entering a name for the category, choose whether the category will be visible on the public OPAC, the owning library, and the type.  Statistical categories owned by library systems are available to all system libraries, while an individual library’s categories are only available to that single unit.

Surveys
^^^^^^^

The Surveys interface has been improved in Evergreen 1.6.1.8.  Detailed instructions with screenshots for creating surveys may be found in the official Evergreen documentation at http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/1.6/draft/html/lsa-survey.html. 

View Items in Transit To/From Your Library
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Transit List feature provides a method for quickly reporting which items are in transit to or from a library with a common set of date ranges.

Work Log
^^^^^^^^

Allows you to view staff actions within the staff client and retrieve patrons or items for each action.
