Evergreen Permissions
---------------------

Evergreen permissions setup is both very complex and poorly documented.  This
section is the product of reverse engineering on the part of PINES/GPLS staff.
Though we believe it is correct as far as our experience with permissions setup
goes, we cannot guarantee its accuracy until we receive documentation and/or
training from the Evergreen developers.

Permissions Groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each user is granted a permissions group, which is a globally-defined set of
permissions created to allow certain types of access, when he/she is created in
the system.  Here are the permission groups available in PINES:

Administrator

- GlobalAdmin – Global Administrator – permissions to administer all of PINES
- LocalAdmin – Local System Administrator – permissions to administer a library
  system
- LibraryManager – Library Branch/Unit Administrator – permissions to administer
  a single library

Cataloger

- SuperCat – Global Cataloger – permissions to administer cataloging in all of
  PINES
- Cat1 – Local System Cataloger – permissions to administer cataloging in a
  library system
- Cat2 – Local Cataloger – permissions to catalog items in a library system 
- Cat3 – Local Cataloger – permissions to catalog items in a library system

Circulator

- Circ1 – Local Circulation Administrator – permissions to manage a library’s
  circulation functions
- Circ2 – Local Circulation Staff – permissions to perform regular circulation
  duties
- Circ3 – Local Circulation Staff – permissions to perform regular circulation
  duties
- Circ4 – Local Circulation Staff – permissions to perform regular circulation
  duties

There is also a StaffNoPerm group under the Patron category, which grants the
staff benefit of not having to owe fines without any additional staff
permissions.

Hierarchical Permissions Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Evergreen employs a hierarchical permissions structure in which "child" groups inherit
permissions settings from "parent" groups.  The basic group is "User", which
contains all Evergreen users.  Above the "User" level are subcategories,
including "Staff," which contains a set of permissions that is inherited by all
"Staff" group members.  "Staff" is subdivided into "Administrator," "Cataloger,"
and "Circulator," and each of these levels may also contain permissions that are
inherited by their subgroup members.  In the case of the "Administrator" group,
a base set of administrative permissions is granted to the "GlobalAdmin,"
"LocalAdmin," and "Library Manager" permissions groups, which are then assigned
to individual users.  See the diagram below for a visual representation of this
structure.

Assigning a permissions group to a user grants them all of the permissions in
the tree.  This means that a LibraryManager assignment equates to granting all
permissions in User + Staff + Administrator + LibraryManager, inclusive.

Permissions Scopes 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Evergreen permissions are "scoped," meaning that "boundaries" are set to limit
staff actions to a single system or branch.  In PINES, there are three scopes:
1. Consortium: the permission applies to the staff member at any location in
PINES.  2. System: the permission applies to any location within the library
system at which the staff member works 3. Branch: the permission applies to the
individual library at which the staff member works.

Context Matters:  Working Location and Workstation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As of Evergreen 1.4.0.4 (which PINES upgraded to in May 2009), Evergreen
permissions rely on the user’s "working location."  By default this is the home
library assigned to the user at the time of registration, but for users who
prefer to use a different home library as a library patron, this can be manually
set in the Admin -> User Permission Editor interface.  For staff such as
LocalAdmins, who need to administer or perform work at more than one location,
each relevant location must be selected.

The other context Evergreen uses is the Staff Client workstation location.  This
is set on the first use of a newly installed staff client.  When editing library
settings, the staff client location must be for the same library for which you
are attempting to change settings.  See the Library Settings section for more
details about this.  Also see the Creating Multiple Staff Client Profiles
section for setting up workstations for administering multiple library locations
from a single location.

TIP:  If you have system-level permissions (as you do as a LocalAdmin), you only
need to be assigned a single working location within your system.  However, if 
the staff member mainly has branch-level permissions (such as a Circ1), you will
need to assign her/him each location where you need permissions to be in effect.

Adding Custom Permissions 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Staff users are assigned a set of permissions and for the Administrator class of
users, some of those permissions are grantable.  A grantable permission is one
that an administrative user can grant individually to a single user.  This is
done in the Admin -> User Permission Editor interface by entering the user’s
library card barcode and adding checkboxes beside the appropriate permissions.
A list of permissions and their definitions is under development by PINES/GPLS
staff.

TIP: Though LocalAdmins have the ability to grant permissions, PINES/GPLS staff
recommends caution when doing so, as customized permissions may cause problems
down the line.  For example, if a staff member changes employment positions at a
library, her/his permissions profile group may change, but any custom
permissions will continue to be assigned unless manually removed by the
LocalAdmin.  It would be beneficial to keep a record of such individualized
changes.

TIP: Locally-assigned permissions override permissions assigned "higher up" in
the hierarchy.  For example, if the Circ2 profile has VIEW_USER assigned at the
Consortium scope, and you assign that same permission to a specific Circ2 at the
Branch scope, that staff member will be limited to viewing/accessing user accounts
 at her/his branch.

Permissions assigned at the permissions profile group level are not able to be
removed on a per user basis.  LocalAdmins must assign a profile with fewer
permissions to decrease the permissions level of a user.
